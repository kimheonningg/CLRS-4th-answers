Show that equation (14.4) follows from equation (14.3) and the initial condition
T(0) = 1. 

let S(n) = sigam i = 0 to n T(i)
Okay.

what if follow greedy strategy.
then the algorithm will cut all the cuts in the same length.
n = i * k + n mod(i) / i is length of the one whose price density is max.


but the case given in 14.1. the solution is 

# 1-3.
Consider a modiûcation of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a
price pi for each rod, each cut incurs a ûxed cost of c. The revenue associated with
a solution is now the sum of the prices of the pieces minus the costs of making the
cuts. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to solve this modiûed problem.

answer.
just need to minus the cut_cost on the price.
in the beginning we set max_val as c[i], which is not cutted so whose cost is 0. so we set cut_p as 0.

max_price(n, cut_cost){

    for i = 1 to n
        max_val = c[i]
        cut_p = 0;
        for k = 1 to floor(n/2)
            temp = c_sub[k]+c_sub[i-k]-cut_cost
            if(max_val < temp)                    
                max_val = temp
                cut_p = k
        c_sub[i] = max_val
        p[i] = cut_p
    
    return c_sub, p
}

Modify CUT-ROD and MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX so that their for loops go up
to only bn=2c, rather than up to n. What other changes to the procedures do you
need to make? How are their running times affected?

already did. nothing changed.
for k = 1 to floor(n/2)
ㄴthis part.

# 1-5
already made the print function

# 1-6
fibbonacci_dp(n){

    f[0] = 1
    f[1] = 1
    if(n<=1)
        return f[n]
    for i = 2 to n
        f[i] = f[i-1]+f[i-2]

    return f[n]
}
T(n) = 2*(n-1) = 2n-2

for n > 2
    # of vertices = n+1
    # of edges = (n-1)*2
