Input : a sequence of n words.
Constraints : 
    1. line length is M
    2. No word exceeds the line length.

Goal:
    minimize the sum of the cubes of the # of extraspace characters.
    
    
the # of the extra space character at the end of the line is 
M -leng of words(from i to j) -(j-i : which represetn # of spaces between words)


this is also how to split the contents.



first get the acculated length


    split[]
    extra_space



    c_len[0] = 0
    for i = 1 to n
        c_len[i] = c_len[i-1] + n[i]

    
    len_lin(i, j) = c_len[j]-c_len[i-1] + j-i + 
    extra_space(i, j) = M-len_lin(i, j)

    while(i < n)
        j = i
        ex_space = M    
        while len_lin(i, j) < M
            len_lin(i, j) = c_len[j]-c_len[i-1] + j-i
