Bitonic euclidean traveling-salesman problem

In the euclidean traveling-salesperson problem, you are given a set of n points in
the plane, and your goal is to Ã»nd the shortest closed tour that connects all n points. 
The general problem is
NP-hard, and its solution is therefore believed to require more than polynomial time (see Chapter 34).
J. L. Bentley has suggested simplifying the problem by considering only bitonic tours, that is, tours that start at the leftmost point, go strictly rightward to the rightmost point, and then go strictly leftward back to the starting point. Figure 14.11(b)
shows the shortest bitonic tour of the same 7 points. In this case, a polynomial-time
algorithm is possible.
Describe an O(n2)-time algorithm for determining an optimal bitonic tour. You
may assume that no two points have the same x-coordinate and that all operations
on real numbers take unit time. (Hint: Scan left to right, maintaining optimal possibilities for the two parts of the tour.) 


Bitonic_tours(P, n){

    upside = [1, n]
    downside = [2, ..., n-1]
    upside_t
    downside_t

    for i = 2 to n-1
        upside_t.insert(downside[i])
        downside_t.pop(downside[i])

        calculate distances of upside_t
