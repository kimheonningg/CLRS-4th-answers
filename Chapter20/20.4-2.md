```plaintext
FIND(u, v):
if u == v:
    return 1
else if u.paths != NIL:
    return u.paths
else
    for each w in Adj[u] // for each adjacent vertices of u
        u.paths <- u.paths + FIND(w, v)
    return u.paths
```

`u.paths` stores the answer (the number of simple paths from u -> v), all initialized as NIL.

This is possible since the given graph is a DAG, and therefore contains no cycles.
